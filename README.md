## Key Findings

### Question 1: Modeling the Temporary Impact Function

**Best Model: Linear Impact Function g(x) = βx + α**

| Ticker | Side | Beta (β) | Alpha (α) | R² |
|--------|------|----------|-----------|-----|
| FROG   | Buy  | 0.000047 | 0.051516  | 0.988 |
| FROG   | Sell | 0.000079 | 0.057907  | 0.968 |
| SOUN   | Buy  | 0.000001 | 0.005637  | 0.844 |
| SOUN   | Sell | 0.000002 | 0.005535  | 0.969 |
| CRWV   | Buy  | 0.000145 | 0.056103  | 0.995 |
| CRWV   | Sell | 0.000142 | 0.046059  | 0.973 |

**Key Insights:**
- Linear models provide excellent fits (R² > 0.84) across all tickers
- CRWV shows highest impact sensitivity (145x higher than SOUN)
- Square root and power law models perform poorly on this data
- Constant marginal impact suggests deep, liquid order books

### Question 2: Optimal Execution Framework

**Mathematical Formulation:**
- Objective: Minimize Σg_t(x_i) subject to Σx_i = S
- For linear impact: Total cost = βS + Nα (independent of allocation!)
- Optimal strategy: Any feasible allocation yields identical cost

**Strategy Analysis:**
All tested strategies (Uniform, Front-loaded, Back-loaded, VWAP-style) yield identical total impact for linear models, confirming theoretical predictions.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing
- High-frequency order book data with 10 levels of depth
- Market order simulation across order sizes 1-200 shares
- Statistical modeling with multiple functional forms
- Robust sampling methodology for computational efficiency

### Optimization Framework
- Analytical solutions for linear models
- Numerical optimization capabilities for complex models
- Comprehensive strategy backtesting framework
- Extension ready for non-linear impact functions

## Practical Implications

1. **Asset Selection:** SOUN offers lowest impact costs for large orders
2. **Order Sizing:** Linear scaling means no optimal order size exists
3. **Execution Timing:** For linear models, timing doesn't affect total cost
4. **Risk Management:** Strategy choice should focus on risk rather than cost minimization

## Model Validation

- Cross-sectional consistency across tickers
- High R² values indicating strong predictive power
- Residual analysis confirms model appropriateness
- Robustness to different sampling methodologies

## Extensions and Future Work

1. **Time-Varying Models:** Incorporate intraday liquidity patterns
2. **Non-Linear Extensions:** Analyze larger order size ranges
3. **Multi-Asset Framework:** Portfolio-level optimization
4. **Real-Time Implementation:** Adaptive strategy adjustment

## Code Quality and Reproducibility

- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling and data validation
- Extensive documentation and comments
- Reproducible results with fixed random seeds where applicable
